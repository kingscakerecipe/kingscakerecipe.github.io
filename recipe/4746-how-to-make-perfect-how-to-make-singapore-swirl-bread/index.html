<li>This is how it looks like. I am not a fan of durian, so this is for my daughter. If you can see, the bread is made up of green and purple colors. This recipe is inspired by this iconic Singapore street food.</li>
<li>Prepare the yudane. -  - In a shallow bowl, add flour and water. -  - <em>The water has to be boiling.</em> -  - Stir to combine well.</li>
<li>It should be a sticky roux. -  - Spread out to cool down faster. -  - Cover with a damp lint-free kitchen towel. -  - Set aside to cool down to room temperature. -  - Once cool, divide into 2 equal portions.</li>
<li>Prepare the pandan dough. -  - Add pandan leaves and water into a blender and blitz until smooth. -  - Transfer thru' a fine sieve over a bowl. -  - Using the back of a spoon, squeeze as much juice out as humanly can. -  - <em>You should have 100g worth of pandan juice. If it is less, add more water.</em></li>
<li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt and yeast well. -  - <em>Do not add the yeast directly on the salt. It will kill the yeast.</em> -  - Gradually pour the pandan juice and coconut cream into the flour mixture while still mixing with a spatula. -  - Once it becomes a dough, knead the dough inside the bowl until all the nooks and crannies of flour are kneaded into the dough, about 5 mins.</li>
