<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-prepare-carrot-cake-with-browned-butter-cream-cheese-frosting-">The ingredients needed to prepare Carrot Cake with Browned Butter Cream Cheese Frosting 🤤:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Provide  Carrot Cake</li>
<li>Get 3 Large eggs, room temperature</li>
<li>Provide 1.5 Cups brown sugar</li>
<li>You need 1 Cup Canola oil</li>
<li>Use 3 Cups grated carrot (about 4 large carrots)</li>
<li>You need 2.5 Cups cake flour</li>
<li>Take 1.5 Teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>Use 1 Teaspoon bicarbonate of soda</li>
<li>You need 1 Teaspoon salt</li>
<li>You need 1.5 Teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
<li>Use 100 g pecan nuts (keep a few aside to decorate cake!)</li>
<li>Use  Browned Butter Cream Cheese Frosting</li>
<li>Use 100 g Butter</li>
<li>Get 175 g Cream Cheese</li>
<li>You need 500 g Icing Sugar</li>
<li>Provide 1 Teaspoon Vanilla Paste</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-carrot-cake-with-browned-butter-cream-cheese-frosting-">Steps to make Carrot Cake with Browned Butter Cream Cheese Frosting 🤤:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 180 degrees Celcius. Before starting the cake, brown 50g of butter. Cut butter into small cubes (all the same size so they melt at the same speed). Place in saucepan and gently melt over low heat. Butter will start bubbling fast and then start to brown and smell deliciously nutty. Give the pot a few swirls until the butter is browned nicely and remove from heat, pour into small bowl and refrigerate so it can solidify. Leave other 50g out at room temp.</li>
<li>For the cake: start beating the eggs together with an electric mixer. Slowly start adding the sugar whilst continuously beating.</li>
<li>Add the oil and mix until fully combined.</li>
<li>Stir in the grated carrots.</li>
<li>Sift together the flour, baking powder, bicarb, salt and cinnamon. Add to wet ingredients and stir to combine. Chop pecans and fold into batter.</li>
<li>Divide batter between two greased cake tins and place in preheated oven. Check cakes after 30 minutes, fork should come out clean. Leave to cool slightly before removing from tins and cooljng on wire rack.</li>
<li>For the frosting: remove solidified brown butter from fridge and pop in microwave for about 15-20 seconds - should not melt but just be a bit softer. Beat brown and normal butters together in a mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Add icing sugar and vanilla paste and beat on low speed to form dry crumbs.</li>
<li>Microwave cream cheese about 20 seconds to soften and add to butter mixture while mixing continuously. You can add more or less cream cheese depending on the consistency you want. I wanted a spreadable frosting.</li>
<li>Frost cake and decorate with pecan nuts.</li>
