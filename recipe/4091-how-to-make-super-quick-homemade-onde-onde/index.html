<li>Take 1/2 TSP Pure Pandan Paste,</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-onde-onde">Instructions to make Onde Onde:</h5>
<ol>
<li>In a large heat proof shallow bowl, add desiccated coconut and salt. -  - Stir to combine well. -  - Prepare a steamer and steam the coconut mixture for about 5 to 10 mins or until the coconut has softened. -  - Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
<li>Prepare the filling. -  - In a spice grinder, add palm sugar. -  - Blitz until fine. -  - Using a 1/3 tsp, scoop and lay each individual scoops onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper. -  - You should have 15 scoops. -  - Cover with cling film and sit in the freezer until frozen.</li>
<li>Prepare the dough. -  - In a blender, add pandan leaves and water. -  - Blitz until smooth. -  - Drain the pandan juice into a bowl thru' a strainer. -  - Using the back of a spoon, squeeze out any excess juice.</li>
<li>Discard the residue. -  - You should have 1/2 cup of pandan juice. -  - <em>If you have less, add water until it reaches 1/2 cup. Discard any excess.</em> -  - Prepare a sauce pot with about 1/2 full with water over medium-high heat.</li>
<li>Bring to a gentle boil while preparing the dough. -  - In a large bowl, add in glutinous rice flour, pandan juice and pandan paste. -  - Mix to combine well. -  - Mix until it comes together into a dough.</li>
<li>The dough should be tacky and smooth. -  - Pinch 20g of the dough and drop into the pot of boiling water. -  - As soon as the dough float to the surface, scoop out using a cooking spider.</li>
<li>Do not off the heat, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer.* -  - Transfer the blanched dough into the rest of the dough. -  - Continue to knead until well combined. -  - The dough should be a tacky and smooth, but not sticky. -  - *If the dough is too dry, add in 1 tsp of water. if the dough is too sticky, add in 1 tsp of flour.*</li>
<li>Assemble the onde onde. -  - Bring the pot of water up to a gentle boil by turning the heat up to medium. -  - Pinch 15g of the dough. -  - <em>Cover the rest of the dough with damp lint free kitchen towel. This will prevent the rest of the dough from drying out.</em></li>
<li>Flatten the dough into a disc. -  - Take 1 of the fillings from the freezer. -  - <em>Leave the rest of the fillings in the freezer or they will melt super fast at room temperature.</em></li>
<li>Put the filling in the middle of the flatten dough. -  - Seal the filling with your fingers. -  - <em>Make sure it is sealed properly.</em> -  - Shape it into a round ball.</li>
<li>Drop the dough ball into the boiling water. -  - Stir the water to prevent the dough ball from sticking at the bottom of the pot. -  - Once the dough float to the top, allow it to boil for another couple of mins. -  - Scoop the dough ball out with a cooking spider.</li>
<li>Transfer the dough ball onto the steamed desiccated coconut. -  - Roll the dough until fully coated. -  - Repeat the process for the remaining onde onde. -  - <em>Do not shape and fill the onde onde all at once, the filling will melt and the onde onde will dry out. Work on 1 dough at a time.</em> -  - Serve immediately.</li>
<li>While popping the last few onde onde in my mouth, I began thinking about the painting which I had envisage while making those kueh. I decided to save the last couple for a bit of an art adventure.</li>
<li>What I did was melting the palm sugar aka gula melaka aka coconut sugar down to a syrupy consistency. To be exact (so you can also try this at home), palm sugar syrup = 50g, fresh lemon juice = 25g and agar agar powder = 1/4 TSP.</li>
<li>I stir all of that together and bring it up to a simmer. I let it simmer for a couple of mins, remove from heat and let it sit for 10 mins. I already chilled a bowl of canola oil, which is 500g, in the fridge overnight. I transferred the syrup mixture into a squeeze bottle and dripped droplets into the chilled oil. If you have a syringe, it will work even better.</li>
<li>Again, I let it chilled in the fridge for at least 10 mins. Drained them thru' a fine strainer, wash it thoroughly under running water and set aside to drain off excess liquid. That's how I got my palm sugar caviar. I also added some coconut flakes which I had dried roasted in a skillet. Sometimes we have to be a rebel and be bold. That plate was the painting which I had envisaged.</li>
</ol>
