<h5 id="instructions-to-make-nyonya-rice-dumpling">Instructions to make Nyonya Rice Dumpling:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the night before. -  - In a large bowl, add blue pea flowers and 800g of warm water. -  - Set aside to cool and allow the flowers to dye the water with a shade of blue. -  - Drain and discard the flowers, keeping the wonderful blue colored water. -  - Wash the glutinous rice under running water and drain.</li>
<li>Keep washing and draining for about 5 times. -  - Add half of the rice into the blue colored water. -  - Season with salt and pepper. -  - Stir to combine well and set aside overnight.</li>
<li>Transfer the other half of the rice into another large bowl. -  - Add in chicken stock, mushrooms, scallops, shrimps, salt and pepper. -  - Stir to combine well and set aside overnight. -  - In another bowl, add chicken, kecap manis, soy sauce, wine, salt, pepper and mushroom powder. -  - Stir to coat the chicken well. -  - Cover with cling film and marinate in the fridge overnight.</li>
<li>Prepare the dumplings. -  - The next day, the mushroom and scallops should have hydrated. -  - Fish them out. Finely dice the mushroom and shred the scallops by simply pulling them apart.</li>
<li>Drain the blue colored rice and discard the water. -  - Drain the other bowl of rice, keeping the water. -  - <em>You will need the water at a later stage.</em></li>
<li>In a skillet over medium heat, add sesame oil. -  - Once the oil is heated up, add in mushrooms. -  - Saute until the mushrooms start to caramelize. -  - Drizzle in some of that rice water. -  - Add in ginger and saute until aromatic.</li>
<li>Add in scallions, season with salt and pepper, saute until well combined. -  - Remove from heat and set aside. -  - In the same skillet over medium heat, add sesame oil. -  - Once the oil is heated up, add in shallots. -  - Saute until translucent.</li>
<li>Add in garlic and saute until aromatic. -  - Add in coriander powder and saute until well combined. -  - Drizzle in some of that rice water to deglaze. -  - Add in galangal, BBQ sauce and shredded scallops.</li>
<li>Saute until well combined. -  - Deglaze with some of that rice water. -  - Season with salt and pepper. -  - Lastly, add in the wintermelon. -  - Give it a final saute, remove from heat and set aside.</li>
<li>I am doing an open-faced concept as shown in the photos. You can choose to wrap the rice and fillings up into pyramid-shaped dumplings if desired. I will include the steps for both concepts.*</li>
<li>Open-faced concept: -  - I am using an electric double-decker steamer. You can use 2 decks of bamboo steamers and steam in a wok over medium heat with water. You will need to do in batches if your bamboo steamers are small. -  - Wipe the bamboo leaves clean with a kitchen towel.</li>
<li>Lay bamboo leaves on the steamer. -  - Lay some pandan leaves over the bamboo leaves. -  - Spoon in the glutinous rice, white and blue separating from one another, over the top. -  - Tied 2 knots of pandan leaves and place them on top of the rice. -  - <em>This is your bottom deck.</em></li>
<li>Cover and steam for 40 mins. -  - Spoon the chicken and mushroom over another deck of steamer. -  - Spreading out evenly. -  - Place this deck over the rice deck. -  - Steam together for another 30 mins or until the rice is fully cooked.</li>
<li>I did it this way so that the flavors of the chicken and mushrooms will infuse the rice and vice versa. I cook the rice 1st cos the rice takes longer time to cook.*</li>
<li>Remove from heat and transfer onto serving plate. -  - Garnish with scallions and serve immediately. -  - If you want the same presentation as shown in the photos, place the white rice into a 4-inch pastry ring. Spoon the chicken and mushroom over the rice. Lastly, blue rice. Using the back of a spoon to compact at every layer. Garnish with some scallions.</li>
<li>Wrapped concept: -  - Clean and wipe the bamboo leaves with a kitchen towel. -  - Bring a large heavy pot of water to a rolling boil. -  - Take 2 bamboo leaves, one on top of the other, take the halfway point, fold and form it into a cone shape.</li>
<li>Add a scoop of the white rice into the cone. -  - Pack it down firmly. -  - Add 2 spoonfuls of the chicken and mushrooms. -  - Add a scoop of blue rice on top. -  - Pack it down firmly.</li>
<li>Fold the leaves down and form a pyramid shape. -  - Tie the dumplings tightly with hemp strings. -  - <em>It takes a few practices until you get it right. Most importantly is to the tie the dumplings tightly.</em></li>
<li>Repeat the process for the remaining dumplings. -  - Add the dumplings into the boiling water. -  - Cover and boil for about 2.5 hours.</li>
<li>At the 2 hours mark, remove one of the dumplings, unwrap and test if it is cooked. -  - If it is cooked, remove from heat, place in a wire cooling rack to drain off excess water and cool down. -  - If it is not yet cooked, continue cooking for another hour and check again, -  - When it is cool enuff to handle, unwrap and serve.</li>
